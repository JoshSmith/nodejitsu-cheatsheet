# The Nodejitsu Cheat Sheet

## "Where's the cheat sheet?!"

The cheat sheet is hosted **[on Nodejitsu](http://cheatsheet.nodejitsu.com)**, of course.

## "The cheat sheet is missing something..."

Oh no! You should do one of the following:

* Find me at #nodejitsu on irc.freenode.net.
* File a github issue.
* Fix it [here](https://github.com/jesusabdullah/nodejitsu-cheatsheet/blob/master/public/json/cheatsheet.json).
